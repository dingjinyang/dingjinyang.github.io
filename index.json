steganography shows immense promise for covert communication, yet existing methods are often constrained by a trilemma of capacity, efficiency, and security. Methods based on Huffman Coding (HC) suffer from poor efficiency and security, while those based on Arithmetic Coding (AC), despite achieving optimal capacity, also pose security risks. Although recent provably secure methods have addressed the security issue, they often do so at the cost of elevated embedding complexity or diminished capacity—failing to match the high capacity exhibited by AC-based methods. To address this trilemma, we adapt Asymmetric Numeral Systems (ANS) for steganography. Our core insight is to repurpose the ANS state machine, using its decoding function for embedding and its encoding function for extraction. To translate this concept into a practical system, we introduce several key innovations. First, we incorporate a streaming architecture with state renormalization to enable the stable embedding of arbitrarily long messages. Second, we employ direct floating-point arithmetic, avoiding costly probability-to-frequency conversions to reduce complexity and precision loss. More critically, we introduce an innovative cryptographic mask mechanism that ensures the sampling process is driven by a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator, thereby achieving provable security. Finally, by optimizing core computations into highly efficient bitwise shift operations, ANStega achieves exceptional embedding and extraction speeds. Experimental results validate that ANStega simultaneously achieves optimal embedding capacity, optimal efficiency (embedding complexity with $O(1)$) and optimal security, successfully resolving the long-standing trilemma in generative steganography.","tags":["Information Hiding"],"title":"Breaking the Generative Steganography Trilemma: ANStega for Optimal Capacity, Efficiency, and Security","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Keep fighting!\n","date":1767075300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1767075300,"objectID":"6aef3e2a29bd9e620d65153984c3e1eb","permalink":"https://dingjinyang.github.io/news/100-citations/","publishdate":"2025-12-30T14:15:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/news/100-citations/","section":"news","summary":"It’s a small milestone, but a huge encouragement for me. 🥳","tags":[],"title":"My publications have been cited 💯 times, according to Google Scholar.","type":"news"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Keep fighting!\n","date":1764810011,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1764810011,"objectID":"92350e1ce0b153bd8a361688757c0d9c","permalink":"https://dingjinyang.github.io/news/ndss26/","publishdate":"2025-12-04T09:00:11+08:00","relpermalink":"/news/ndss26/","section":"news","summary":"Congrats to Dr. Yaofei Wang, again! 🎊","tags":[],"title":"One work on Provably Secure Steganography got accepted by NDSS 2026!","type":"news"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Keep fighting!\n","date":1761465600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1761465600,"objectID":"dbffde8927ed3310016ccf9d3afca4c1","permalink":"https://dingjinyang.github.io/news/huickthon-s2/","publishdate":"2025-10-26T16:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/news/huickthon-s2/","section":"news","summary":"This was my first hackathon.

Provable security in steganography, a long-sought goal, has become feasible with deep generative models. However, current methods often either compromise security or introduce significant computational complexity, failing to provide secure and efficient covert communication. This paper introduces SparSamp, an efficient provably secure steganography method based on sparse sampling. SparSamp embeds messages by converting them into message-driven sampling. It enhances extraction accuracy and embedding capacity by increasing the sampling intervals and making the sampling process sparse. SparSamp preserves the original probability distribution of the generative model, thus ensuring security. It introduces only $O(1)$ additional complexity per sampling step, which does not impact the speed of model generation, resulting in the fastest embedding speed available. SparSamp is designed to be plug-and-play; message embedding can be achieved by simply replacing the sampling component of an existing generative model with SparSamp. We implemented SparSamp in text, image, and audio generation models. It can achieve embedding speeds of up to 755 bits/second with GPT-2, 5046 bits/second with DDPM, and 9,223 bits/second with WaveRNN, enabling secure covert communication.","tags":["Information Hiding"],"title":"SparSamp: Efficient Provably Secure Steganography Based on Sparse Sampling","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Keep fighting!\n","date":1737594011,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1737594011,"objectID":"e82ba21b9217e2738a9b6234f4a15165","permalink":"https://dingjinyang.github.io/news/sec25/","publishdate":"2025-01-23T09:00:11+08:00","relpermalink":"/news/sec25/","section":"news","summary":"Congrats to Dr. Yaofei Wang! 🎉","tags":[],"title":"One work on Provably Secure Steganography got accepted by USENIX Security 2025!","type":"news"},{"authors":["Jinyang Ding"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1717560000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1717560000,"objectID":"6314b0eda1fbadb647e770f9e95ec4b5","permalink":"https://dingjinyang.github.io/publication/ustc_thesis/","publishdate":"2024-06-05T12:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ustc_thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"Information security issues have become increasingly prominent as the internet undergoes rapid development and widespread popularity. While traditional cryptographic solutions secure content confidentiality, they may still attract attackers’ attention. Thus, modern communication security requires not only the confidentiality of information but also the concealment of the process, leading to the emergence and widespread application of information hiding techniques. Steganography, a significant branch of information hiding, enables the covert embedding of secret messages within various carriers, which is crucial for military communications and personal privacy protection. Traditional modification-based steganographic algorithms can only achieve empirical security. Achieving provable security has always been an important pursuit for the steganographic community. One prerequisite for achieving provably secure steganography is the existence of a sampler that can strictly sample according to the carrier’s distribution. The swift advancement of deep generative models and the prevalence of AI-generated data have provided new techniques and environments for provably secure generative steganography, advancing research in this field.\nConsidering the rapid advances in computational power and the potential emergence of new attack vectors, traditional encryption techniques will likely become insecure in a few decades, necessitating more secure encryption measures to meet long-term security needs. Honey encryption is a novel technique that aims to produce a plausiblelooking decoy plaintext when an attacker attempts to decrypt the ciphertext with a wrong key. Thus, even if an attacker obtains all possible plaintexts through brute-force attacks, identifying the true plaintext among them is still challenging. Such a design significantly enhances encryption security, making honey encryption an effective tool against brute-force attacks and particularly suitable for scenarios requiring long-term protection against powerful attacks.\nThe thesis addresses the two core needs of data privacy protection—concealment and confidentiality—and revolves around researching provably secure generative steganography and honey encryption. The main contributions and innovations of the thesis can be summarized as follows.\n**1. Efficient and Provably Secure Steganographic Algorithm Based on Distribution Copies**\nThe existing provably secure steganographic algorithms can be categorized into three types: those based on rejection sampling suffer from low embedding rates and slow speed; those based on arithmetic coding and those based on sample space grouping are capable of achieving higher embedding rates and speed, but their implementations are challenging to meet the theoretical assumptions, therefore they cannot achieve the expected security. Essentially, all the aforementioned algorithms use the index values or function values of samples to express the message. To overcome the limitations of existing algorithms, this thesis proposes an efficient and provably secure steganographic algorithm based on distribution copies. By creating multiple distribution copies by rotating the probability distribution provided by the generative models, the index values of the distribution copies are employed to express the message. Security proof is given from the perspective of distribution preservation. The embedding rate of the algorithm is significantly enhanced by recursive grouping. Taking the text generation task as an example, performance tests are conducted. Experimental results show that the embedding rate of this steganographic algorithm can approach the theoretical limit. Compared with the normal generation, the introduced additional time is relatively small, ensuring the algorithm’s efficiency in practical applications. Furthermore, the algorithm is deployed on the text-to-speech task, verifying its versatility.\n**2. Honey Encryption Scheme for Natural Language Text Based on Deep Generative Models and Arithmetic Coding**\nThe core of honey encryption is the distribution-transforming encoder (DTE). Existing DTEs typically leverage traditional statistical models and a fixed-length encoding scheme based on the cumulative distribution function (CDF). However, these schemes fall short in modeling capability and generalization when dealing with complex data and struggle to maintain the original distribution. Starting with the minimization of modeling and encoding losses and applying ideas from the domain of provably secure generative steganography, this thesis designs a DTE based on deep generative models and arithmetic coding. It begins by tokenizing the plaintext, then encodes the tokens into a seed using arithmetic coding, leveraging the probability distribution provided by a deep generative model. To eliminate distinguishable characteristics, pseudo-random padding schemes are conceived at the plaintext and seed levels. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a high compression ratio and little encoding loss. The scheme can achieve little modeling loss and high security when using large models. ### Key Words information hiding; steganography; provably secure steganography; honey encryption; generative model; arithmetic coding ### 标题 生成式可证安全文本隐写及其应用 ### 摘要 随着互联网的迅猛发展与广泛普及，信息安全问题日益突出。传统的基于密码学的解决方案虽能保障内容保密，但可能引起攻击者的注意。因此，现代通信安全既要求内容保密又希望过程隐蔽，信息隐藏技术应运而生并得到广泛应用。隐写术作为信息隐藏的重要分支，能将秘密消息隐秘地嵌入到各类信息载体中，从而实现隐蔽通信或存储，对军事通信和个人隐私保护至关重要。传统的修改式隐写只能停留在经验安全，实现可证安全一直是隐写领域的一大追求。实现可证安全隐写的一个前提是存在一个能够严格按照载体分布进行采样的采样器。深度生成模型的快速发展和生成数据的流行为可证安全隐写带来全新的技术手段和伪装环境，促进了生成式可证安全隐写的研究。\n考虑到计算能力的快速进步以及未来可能出现的新型攻击手段，现有的传统密码学很可能在几十年后就不再安全，因此需要更加强大的加密措施应对长期安全需求。蜜罐加密是一种新型密码学技术，其目标是：若尝试使用错误密钥来解密密文，会得到看似合理的诱饵明文，这样，即使攻击者通过暴力破解获得了所有可能的明文，也难以从中定位出唯一的真明文。这样的设计显著提升了加密的安全性，使得蜜罐加密成为抵御暴力破解攻击的有效手段，特别适用于那些需要长期保护和对抗强大计算能力攻击的场景。\n本文从数据隐私保护的两大核心需求——隐蔽性和保密性着手，围绕生成式可证安全隐写和蜜罐加密展开研究。本文的主要工作和创新点总结如下。\n**1. 提出了一种基于分布副本的高效可证安全隐写构造**\n现有的可证安全隐写构造可分为三种：基于拒绝采样的隐写构造嵌入率低、速度慢；基于算术编码的隐写构造和基于样本空间分组的隐写构造虽然能达到较高的嵌入率和较快的速度，但是具体实现过程难以满足理论假设，因此无法达到预期的安全性。上述方法本质上都是在使用样本的索引值或样本的函数值来表达消息。为了突破这些方法的局限，本文提出了基于分布副本的高效可证安全隐写构造。通过循环移位的方式为生成模型给出的概率分布创建多个分布副本，并利用分布副本的索引值来表达消息。从分布保持的角度，给出了这种隐写构造的安全性证明。通过递归分组的思想，显著提升了这种隐写构造的嵌入率。以文本生成任务为例，对这种隐写构造进行了性能测试。实验结果表明，该隐写构造的嵌入率能接近理论极限。与正常生成相比，该隐写构造引入的额外时间相对较小，这确保了它在实际应用中的高效性。此外，将该隐写构造应用于语音合成任务上，验证了该隐写构造的通用性。\n**2. 提出了一种基于深度生成模型和算术编码的文本蜜罐加密方案**\n蜜罐加密的核心是分布转换编码器 (DTE) ，现有的 DTE 通常采用传统的统计模型和基于累积分布函数的定长编码方案。然而，这种方案在处理复杂数据时显示出建模能力、泛化能力差，而且往往不能较好地保持原始分布。本文对生成式隐写与蜜罐加密之间的关系进行分析，并尝试将生成式可证安全隐写领域的先进思想应用于文本蜜罐加密系统的设计中，提出了一种基于深度生成模型和算术编码的 DTE：首先对明文进行分词，然后使用算术编码根据深度生成模型预测的概率分布将明文编码为种子。为了消除可区分特征，在明文和种子两个层面上设计了伪随机填充方案。实验结果表明，所提出的方案压缩率较高、编码损失较小，在使用规模较大的模型时，建模损失较小、安全性较高。 ### 关键词 信息隐藏；隐写；可证安全隐写；蜜罐加密；生成模型；算术编码","tags":["Information Hiding"],"title":"Provably Secure Generative Linguistic Steganography and Its Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xin Zhang","Kejiang Chen","Jinyang Ding","Yuqi Yang","Weiming Zhang","Nenghai Yu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1707278400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1707278400,"objectID":"3e2fdc505412582a7748addf59bc3c93","permalink":"https://dingjinyang.github.io/publication/tifs24_eccstega/","publishdate":"2024-02-07T12:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/tifs24_eccstega/","section":"publication","summary":"Steganography is the technique of hiding secret messages within seemingly harmless covers to elude examination by censors.

A highly covert and secure covert channel for transmitting sensitive information must be developed to safeguard the privacy of communication users and prevent occurrences of eavesdropping on confidential data transmissions. Most methods build covert channels by tunneling multimedia streams. However, the problem of packet loss caused by fluctuations in network transmission is not considered. This study proposes a covert communication method that is robust to network anomalies and is based on cross-modal information retrieval and provably secure steganography.\n#### Method\nWe propose a general covert communication framework named robust covert communication (RoCC), which is based on cross-modal information retrieval and provably secure steganography. Artificially generated information from artificial intelligence (AI) systems, including deep synthesis models, AI-driven artwork, intelligent voice assistants, and conversational chatbots, has emerged. These AI models can synthesize multimodal data, such as videos, images, audio, and text. The practical application of provably secure steganography has become a reality as generative models make significant strides. Thus, we introduce generative models and provably secure steganography techniques into our framework, embedding secret messages within the cover text data. Furthermore, the domain of speech synthesis and recognition has witnessed the advent of numerous mature open-source models, facilitating seamless cross-modal conversion between speech and text. Our approach employs a combination of direct and indirect communication. In direct communication using voice over internet protocol (VoIP) network call service, real-time synthesized audio stream data are delivered, and the receiver can restore the text through voice recognition. Indirect communication uses a public network database for steganographic text data transmission. The receiver restores lost text semantics because of network packet loss and speech recognition errors via text semantic similarity matching. The entire communication process can be succinctly described as follows. Assuming that the sender of confidential data is Alice and the recipient is Bob, Alice and Bob share the same generative model and parameter settings for provably secure steganography. Alice embeds the confidential data into the generated text data using provably secure steganography techniques and publishes it on a publicly accessible and searchable network database. The only means of direct communication between the two parties is through VoIP network voice calls. Thus, the potential loss of network data packets is acknowledged. On the basis of the preserved semantic information, Bob performs cross-modal information retrieval from the public database and successfully locates the corresponding steganographic text data within the cover text. Subsequently, Bob recovers the confidential data from the steganographic texts by using the same generative model and parameter settings for steganography.\n#### Result\nThe results of speech recognition experiments indicate that speech recognition often leads to semantic loss issues. The sentence error rate of the best model, standing at a mere 0.612 5, fails to meet the text recovery capability required for constructing covert channels through direct cross-modal transformations. Text similarity analysis experiments indicate that the best model can achieve a recall metric of 1.0, thereby theoretically enabling complete semantic information restoration. The experiment on combating network packet loss shows that RoCC achieves an impressive information recovery rate of 0.992 1 when the packet loss rate is 10% with a K value of 2. This finding demonstrates the exceptional resilience of RoCC to network anomalies and establishes it as the current state-of-the-art solution. In the experiment on real-time performance, we validate the high efficiency of the RoCC system in various components, such as speech synthesis and recognition, secure steganographic encoding and decoding, and text semantic similarity analysis. These results demonstrate the ability of RoCC to meet the real-time requirements of covert channel communication. In comparative experiments, RoCC is compared with eight representative methods. The results show that RoCC has outstanding advantages in terms of protocol versatility, robustness, and data steganography as provable security. Compared with the current robust model, RoCC shows increased resistance to packet loss rate by 5% in the antinetwork packet loss experiment.\n#### Conclusion\nThe covert communication framework proposed in this study combines the advantages of provably secure steganography, generative machine learning methods, and cross-modal retrieval methods, making the covert communication process increasingly stealthy and secure. We also implement the first method of using semantic similarity to restore data communication lost due to an abnormal transmission process. After experimental verification, our framework meets the requirements of real-time communication in terms of performance, and the real-time transmission rate reaches 73～136 bps.\n### 标题\n利用跨模态信息检索的鲁棒隐蔽通信\n### 摘要\n#### 目的\n隐蔽通信是信息安全领域的一个重要研究方向，现有基于多媒体数据流构建隐蔽信道的方法，未考虑网络传输时波动产生的数据包丢失问题。本文提出一种基于跨数据模态信息检索技术的对网络异常具有鲁棒性的隐蔽通信方法，同时可以满足高隐蔽性和高安全性的要求。\n#### 方法\n提出了一个名为 RoCC（robust covert communication）的通用隐蔽通信框架，它基于跨模态信息检索和可证明安全的隐写技术。所提方法将直接通信和间接通信两种形式相结合。直接通信通过 VoIP（voice over internet protocol）网络通话服务进行，传递实时生成的音频流数据，接收方可以通过语音识别将其还原为文本；而间接通信则借助公共网络数据库进行载密数据的传输，接收方通过文本语义相似度匹配的方式来还原完整语义的载密文本数据，这有助于解决网络数据包丢失和语音识别误差导致的文本语义丢失的问题。\n#### 结果\n经实验测试，本文方法在协议上具有更好的通用性，相对 Saenger 方法在丢包率抵抗能力方面提高了 5%，所用隐写算法满足可证安全性。同时，RoCC 的数据传输率有 73～136 bps（bit per second），能够满足实时通信需要。\n#### 结论\nRoCC 隐蔽通信框架综合可证明安全隐写、生成式机器学习方法和跨模态检索方法的优势，与现有的方法比较，具有更加隐蔽和安全的优势，并且是当前对数据传输丢包异常最鲁棒的模型。","tags":["Information Hiding"],"title":"RoCC: Robust Covert Communication Based on Cross-Modal Information Retrieval","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Pronunciation of My Name Generated by ChatGPT.\nIn English, the name “丁锦扬” is typically pronounced as “Ding Jin-yang.” Here is a breakdown of the pronunciation for each character:\n丁 (Ding): Pronounced like the English word “ding.” 锦 (Jin): Pronounced like the English word “gin” with a soft “j” sound at the beginning. 扬 (Yang): Pronounced like the English word “young” with a “y” sound at the beginning instead of a “j” sound.

Although provably secure steganography has been proposed for decades, it has not been mainstream in this field because its strict requirements (such as a perfect sampler and an explicit data distribution) are challenging to satisfy in traditional data environments. The popularity of deep generative models is gradually increasing and can provide an excellent opportunity to solve this problem. Several methods attempting to achieve provably secure steganography based on deep generative models have been proposed in recent years. However, they cannot achieve the expected security in practice due to unrealistic conditions, such as the balanced grouping of discrete elements and a perfect match between the message and channel distributions. In this paper, we propose a new provably secure steganography method in practice named Discop, which constructs several \"distribution copies\" during the generation process. At each time step of generation, the message determines from which \"distribution copy\" to sample. As long as the receiver agrees on some shared information with the sender, he can extract the message without error. To further improve the embedding rate, we recursively construct more \"distribution copies\" by creating Huffman trees. We prove that Discop can strictly maintain the original distribution so that the adversary cannot perform better than random guessing. Moreover, we conduct experiments on multiple generation tasks for diverse digital media, and the results show that Discop's security and efficiency outperform those of previous methods.","tags":["Information Hiding"],"title":"Discop: Provably Secure Steganography in Practice Based on “Distribution Copies”","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Keep fighting!\n","date":1678496411,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678496411,"objectID":"93592d0d08bdfec5b3b7f304fc87250b","permalink":"https://dingjinyang.github.io/news/sp23/","publishdate":"2023-03-11T09:00:11+08:00","relpermalink":"/news/sp23/","section":"news","summary":"My first first-author paper. 😄","tags":[],"title":"One work on Provably Secure Steganography got accepted by Oakland (IEEE S\u0026P) 2023!","type":"news"},{"authors":["Xilong Wang","Yaofei Wang","Kejiang Chen","Jinyang Ding","Weiming Zhang","Nenghai Yu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1676698700,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676698700,"objectID":"c8fe461bb26e654f37c7d86f7b5e0945","permalink":"https://dingjinyang.github.io/publication/icassp23_icstega/","publishdate":"2023-02-18T13:38:20+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/icassp23_icstega/","section":"publication","summary":"Nowadays, social media has become the preferred communication platform for web users but brought security threats. Linguistic steganography hides secret data into text and sends it to the intended recipient to realize covert communication. Compared to edit-based linguistic steganography, generation-based approaches largely improve the payload capacity. However, existing methods can only generate stego text alone. Another common behavior in social media is sending semantically related image-text pairs. In this paper, we put forward a novel image captioning-based stegosystem, where the secret messages are embedded into the generated captions. Thus, the semantics of the stego text can be controlled and the secret data can be transmitted by sending semantically related image-text pairs. To balance the conflict between payload capacity and semantic preservation, we proposed a new sampling method called Two-Parameter Semantic Control Sampling to cutoff low-probability words. Experimental results have shown that our method can control diversity, payload capacity, security, and semantic accuracy at the same time.","tags":["Information Hiding"],"title":"ICStega: Image Captioning-based Semantically Controllable Linguistic Steganography","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jinyang Ding"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1590984000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590984000,"objectID":"a67ec4f63e7486aa0d320dc6e08a7555","permalink":"https://dingjinyang.github.io/publication/cumt_thesis/","publishdate":"2020-06-01T12:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cumt_thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"With the rapid development of the Internet, digital multimedia information has become an indispensable part of people's lives, and the copyright issues are becoming increasingly prominent. As an important method to solve the copyright problem, digital watermarking technology embeds a specific piece of information named watermark into the carrier information, which can provide proof of ownership for the copyright owner.\nThe robust blind watermarking based on uniform log-polar mapping (ULPM) is implemented, the details are improved, and the algorithm flow and parameter values are optimized. The watermark used for embedding consists of two parts: informative sequence and tracking sequence. The watermark embedding algorithm embeds the watermark into the DFT amplitude spectrum of the carrier image according to the ULPM mapping table. The watermark extraction algorithm locates the watermark by performing cross-correlation operation, and the message is extracted. The watermark embedding end and the watermark extraction end only need to share one key to realize the blind extraction of the watermark. In order to improve the invisibility, distortion compensation is performed in the spatial domain based on the masking characteristics of the human visual system after embedding the watermark, while error correction coding and spread spectrum technology are used to improve the robustness of the watermark. Based on these, a watermark comprehensive evaluation system is designed and implemented. Eight representative images are selected from the standard test images database as the test image set. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed watermarking scheme has good invisibility and computational efficiency. And the watermark is robust to common signal processing such as JPEG compression with a quality factor of 20 or higher, Gaussian filtering with a filter size of 3×3, and so on. It is also robust to common geometrical attacks such as rotation at any angle, proportional scaling with a scaling factor of 0.75 to 1.40, and cropping with a ratio of more than 45%. ### Key Words information hiding; digital watermarking; geometric attacks; uniform logpolar mapping; distortion compensation ### 标题 抗几何失真的鲁棒数字水印的研究与实现 ### 摘要 随着互联网的迅速发展，数字多媒体信息已成为人们生活中不可或缺的组成部分，随之而来的版权问题日益凸显。数字水印技术将一段特定的信息即水印嵌入到载体信息中，为版权所有者提供所有权证明，是解决版权问题的一种重要方法。\n本课题实现了基于均匀对数极坐标映射 (ULPM) 的鲁棒盲水印框架，并完善 了其细节，优化了算法流程和参数取值。用于嵌入的水印由两部分组成：消息序 列和跟踪序列。水印嵌入算法根据 ULPM 映射表将水印嵌入到载体图像的 DFT 幅度谱中。水印提取算法通过互相关运算来定位水印，从而提取出其携带的消息。 水印嵌入端与水印提取端只需要共享一个密钥，就能实现水印的盲提取。在嵌入 水印后，基于人类视觉系统的掩蔽特性在空域进行失真补偿，以提升其不可见性； 使用纠错编码、扩频技术，以满足其鲁棒性。在此基础上，设计并实现了一个水 印综合评估系统，从标准测试图数据库中选取了 8 幅具有代表性的图像作为测试 图像集。实验结果表明，提出的水印方案具有良好的不可见性、计算效率。对质 量因数为 20 以上的 JPEG 压缩、滤波器大小为 3×3 的高斯滤波等简单攻击，任意角度的旋转、缩放因子为 0.75~1.40 的等比例缩放、比例为 45% 以上的裁剪等 几何攻击具有良好的鲁棒性。 ### 关键词 信息隐藏；数字水印；几何攻击；均匀对数极坐标映射；失真补偿","tags":["Information Hiding"],"title":"Research on Robust Digital Watermarking Resilient to Geometric Distortion","type":"publication"}]
