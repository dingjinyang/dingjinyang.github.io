Despite having been proposed several decades ago, provably secure steganography has not gained popularity among researchers due to its rigorous data requirements. Recent advancements in generative models have enabled these researchers to provide explicit data distributions, which has contributed to the development of provably secure steganography methods. However, these methods depend on the assumption of a preshared key. In practical settings, these methods face various challenges, including key agreement, key updating, and user expansion. Although public-key steganography provides a viable solution, existing public-key steganography approaches are burdened with inefficiency and complex implementation in practical scenarios. In this paper, we proposes a practical public-key steganography method based on elliptic curve cryptography and a generative model. This method is the first comprehensive and practical approach to public-key steganography and steganographic key exchange. Additionally, we provide a specific instance to illustrate the proposed method. The security of the proposed construction is also proven based on computational complexity theory. Further experiments have demonstrated the security and efficiency of the proposed method.","tags":["Information Hiding"],"title":"Provably Secure Public-Key Steganography Based on Elliptic Curve

Covert communication is a pivotal research area in the field of information security.A highly covert and secure covert channel for transmitting sensitive information must be developed to safeguard the privacy of communication users and prevent occurrences of eavesdropping on confidential data transmissions.Most methods build covert channels by tunneling multimedia streams.However,the problem of packet loss caused by fluctuations in network transmission is not considered.This study proposes a covert communication method that is robust to network anomalies and is based on cross-modal information retrieval and provably secure steganography.**Method** We propose a general covert communication framework named robust covert communication(RoCC),which is based on cross-modal information retrieval and provably secure steganography.Artificially generated information from artificial intelligence(AI) systems,including deep synthesis models,AI-driven artwork,intelligent voice assistants,and conversational chatbots,has emerged.These AI models can synthesize multimodal data,such as videos,images,audio,and text.The practical application of provably secure steganography has become a reality as generative models make significant strides.Thus,we introduce generative models and provably secure steganography techniques into our framework,embedding secret messages within the cover text data.Furthermore,the domain of speech synthesis and recognition has witnessed the advent of numerous mature open-source models,facilitating seamless cross-modal conversion between speech and text.Our approach employs a combination of direct and indirect communication.In direct communication using voice over internet protocol(VoIP) network call service,realtime synthesized audio stream data are delivered,and the receiver can restore the text through voice recognition.Indirect communication uses a public network database for steganographic text data transmission.The receiver restores lost text semantics because of network packet loss and speech recognition errors via text semantic similarity matching.The entire communication process can be succinctly described as follows.Assuming that the sender of confidential data is Alice and the recipient is Bob,Alice and Bob share the same generative model and parameter settings for provably secure steganography.Alice embeds the confidential data into the generated text data using provably secure steganography techniques and publishes it on a publicly accessible and searchable network database.The only means of direct communication between the two parties is through VoIP network voice calls.Thus,the potential loss of network data packets is acknowledged.On the basis of the preserved semantic information,Bob performs cross-modal information retrieval from the public database and successfully locates the corresponding steganographic text data within the cover text.Subsequently,Bob recovers the confidential data from the steganographic texts by using the same generative model and parameter settings for steganography.**Result** The results of speech recognition experiments indicate that speech recognition often leads to semantic loss issues.The sentence error rate of the best model,standing at a mere 0.612 5,fails to meet the text recovery capability required for constructing covert channels through direct cross-modal transformations.Text similarity analysis experiments indicate that the best model can achieve a recall metric of 1.0,thereby theoretically enabling complete semantic information restoration.The experiment on combating network packet loss shows that RoCC achieves an impressive information recovery rate of 0.992 1 when the packet loss rate is 10% with a K value of 2.This finding demonstrates the exceptional resilience of RoCC to network anomalies and establishes it as the current state-of-the-art solution.In the experiment on realtime performance,we validate the high efficiency of the RoCC system in various components,such as speech synthesis and recognition,secure steganographic encoding and decoding,and text semantic similarity analysis.These results demonstrate the ability of RoCC to meet the real-time requirements of covert channel communication.In comparative experiments,RoCC is compared with eight representative methods.The results show that RoCC has outstanding advantages in terms of protocol versatility,robustness,and data steganography as provable security.Compared with the current robust model,RoCC shows increased resistance to packet loss rate by 5% in the antinetwork packet loss experiment.**Conclusion** The covert communication framework proposed in this study combines the advantages of provably secure steganography,generative machine learning methods,and cross-modal retrieval methods,making the covert communication process increasingly stealthy and secure.We also implement the first method of using semantic similarity to restore data communication lost due to an abnormal transmission process.After experimental verification,our framework meets the requirements of real-time communication in terms of performance,and the real-time transmission rate reaches 73~136 bps.","tags":["Information Hiding"],"title":"RoCC: Robust Covert Communication Based on Cross-Modal Information

Although provably secure steganography has been proposed for decades, it has not been mainstream in this field because its strict requirements (such as a perfect sampler and an explicit data distribution) are challenging to satisfy in traditional data environments. The popularity of deep generative models is gradually increasing and can provide an excellent opportunity to solve this problem. Several methods attempting to achieve provably secure steganography based on deep generative models have been proposed in recent years. However, they cannot achieve the expected security in practice due to unrealistic conditions, such as the balanced grouping of discrete elements and a perfect match between the message and channel distributions. In this paper, we propose a new provably secure steganography method in practice named Discop, which constructs several \"distribution copies\" during the generation process. At each time step of generation, the message determines from which \"distribution copy\" to sample. As long as the receiver agrees on some shared information with the sender, he can extract the message without error. To further improve the embedding rate, we recursively construct more \"distribution copies\" by creating Huffman trees. We prove that Discop can strictly maintain the original distribution so that the adversary cannot perform better than random guessing. Moreover, we conduct experiments on multiple generation tasks for diverse digital media, and the results show that Discop's security and efficiency outperform those of previous methods.","tags":["Information Hiding"],"title":"Discop: Provably Secure Steganography in Practice Based on “Distribution Copies”","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Keep fighting!\n","date":1678496411,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678496411,"objectID":"93592d0d08bdfec5b3b7f304fc87250b","permalink":"https://dingjinyang.github.io/news/sp23/","publishdate":"2023-03-11T09:00:11+08:00","relpermalink":"/news/sp23/","section":"news","summary":"This was my first first-author paper. 😄","tags":[],"title":"One work on Provably Secure Steganography got accepted by Oakland (IEEE S\u0026P) 2023!","type":"news"},{"authors":["Xilong Wang","Yaofei Wang","Kejiang Chen","Jinyang Ding","Weiming Zhang","Nenghai Yu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1676698700,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676698700,"objectID":"c8fe461bb26e654f37c7d86f7b5e0945","permalink":"https://dingjinyang.github.io/publication/icassp23_icstega/","publishdate":"2023-02-18T13:38:20+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/icassp23_icstega/","section":"publication","summary":"Nowadays, social media has become the preferred communication platform for web users but brought security threats. Linguistic steganography hides secret data into text and sends it to the intended recipient to realize covert communication. Compared to edit-based linguistic steganography, generation-based approaches largely improve the payload capacity. However, existing methods can only generate stego text alone. Another common behavior in social media is sending semantically related image-text pairs. In this paper, we put forward a novel image captioning-based stegosystem, where the secret messages are embedded into the generated captions. Thus, the semantics of the stego text can be controlled and the secret data can be transmitted by sending semantically related image-text pairs. To balance the conflict between payload capacity and semantic preservation, we proposed a new sampling method called Two-Parameter Semantic Control Sampling to cutoff low-probability words. Experimental results have shown that our method can control diversity, payload capacity, security, and semantic accuracy at the same time.","tags":["Information Hiding"],"title":"ICStega: Image Captioning-based Semantically Controllable Linguistic Steganography","type":"publication"}]
